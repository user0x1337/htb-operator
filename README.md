HTB-Operator is a project developed and maintained by [user0x1337](https://github.com/user0x1337). It interacts with the API of [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), a popular cybersecurity training platform. The main objective is to save time while interacting with the platform of HTB.

# Restrictions on Windows
Windows imposes certain restrictions or obstacles, which result in not supporting all features. Features/commands which will not work:
* VPN: Starting and stopping

# Installation
HTB-Operator is written in Python. In general, it can be executed on every OS if python is installed on this OS. But it was only tested on Linux (Kali, Ubuntu) and has some limitations on Windows (I was not in the mood for migrating some features for Windows...maybe later).

It is strongly recommended to create a venv. Use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/) (which will automatically create a virtual python environment) to install `htb-operator`:
```bash
pipx install htb-operator
```

# Configuration
You need an API-token from HTB. For that:
1. Visit the URL: [https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/settings](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/settings)

2. Click on "Create App Token"

3. Create a token
   
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/045e6828-fa0b-4cc7-b644-33384fc1e901)

4. Store the token
   
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eb05a1f-4716-4d23-869f-29255fb7404f)

5. Call `htb-operator init -api YOUR_API_TOKEN`

# Commands
The tool is command based. You can call `-h` or `--help` for displaying the help information in each stage. The "top level" commands are displayed if you call the programm without any arguments:


```bash 
htb-operator
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbb1a80a-8005-40bd-86c6-ac3ff32dabf0)




# init
The init command should be the first command you use. As already mentioned above, you need to register your generated API-Key using the init command:
```bash
htb-operator init -api YOUR_API_TOKEN
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5f3792b-46a8-4211-82dd-5aea5f516044)

The init command also supports to indicate an alternative URL for accessing HTB API. This should only be used with caution and in an unlikely case when HTB itself changes the API-URL.

# Info 
The `info` command retireves the information for a user. If no user is indicated, it will display the information for the authenticated user, i.e. for your user. 
```bash
htb-operator info
```

### `-s` / `--username`
Using `-s USERNAME` or `--username USERNAME` you can search for the user with the username `USERNAME` and display its profile. E.g.
```bash
htb-operator info -s HTBBot
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a613234-4dce-4f41-8927-cf004c857cdb)


### `-a` / `--activity`
Usually, the activity is limited to the recent 20 entries. Using `-a` or `--activity` shows the entire activity history without any limits.
```bash
htb-operator info -a
```
 
 `-s` / `--username` works with this flag, too.
```bash
htb-operator info -a -s HTBBot
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/addda738-5435-4e66-9058-2efe81ca4a65)


# certificate
You can list or download obtained certification of completion. 

### `-l` / `--list`
List all obtained certification of completion.
```bash
htb-operator certificate --list
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9fabf5d-cb2a-4663-812a-55cd030ff275)


### download
Using the `download` subcommand, you are able to download the certificate. With `--id` you have to indicate the certification id (e.g. obtained by listing all certificates) and with `-f` or `--filename`, you can set the target directory and the target filename.

# machine
The machine command provides commands for listing all available machines, displaying info about a specific machine, stop, reset and start a machine, and so on. 

## list
Lists all active and retired machines. Furthermore, you can add some filter flags for optimizing your view. Check out the provided flags with `htb-operator machine list -h`. 
```bash
htb-operator machine list
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ab1f19-d695-448c-816c-62268dc806eb)

Active machines which will be retired soon, are flagged as `✘/✔`.

### `--limit` 
As default only the 20 recent machines are displayed. If you want to increase or decrease the number of displyed machine, just use the `--limit <NUMBER>` flag. For example:
```bash
htb-operator machine list --limit 10
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2ad559b-944a-470e-932a-429d8d93e6b3)

### `--retired`
If the `--retired` flag is set, only retired machines are displayed. 
```bash
htb-operator machine list --retired
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da96ca5a-ff12-4bff-9edc-57319304f2ed)


### `--active`
If the `--active` flag is set, only active machines are displayed. 
```bash
htb-operator machine list --active
```

### `--group-by-os` 
You can change grouping of the result set. Instead of grouping the result by `Retired` and `Active`, you can group the result by OS.
```bash
htb-operator machine list --group-by-os
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dcfbcde-c640-4281-849c-8e98bc48aa52)

## start
Start the instance of a given machine. If another machine already runs, you will asked for terminating the running machine before starting the new one. You must indicate the ID of the machine using `--id` flag or the name using `--name` 
```bash
htb-operator machine start --id 620
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e13bdb3-e755-4a6a-9cee-b08b6884c56a)


### `--start-vpn` 
If you use this flag, a VPN connection will automatically be established based on the configured VPN-Server. This operation needs **root/sudo/admin** permission. In Linux, you will be asked for entering your sudo password. 
```bash
htb-operator machine start --id 620 --start-vpn
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2820fa16-0aa7-49fa-940e-09c0d9a67b38)


### `--update-hosts-file`
If you use this flag, the hosts file in `/etc/hosts` (Linux) or `/drivers/etc/hosts` (Windows, not tested) will be updated. The hostname of the machine plus the suffix `htb` (i.e. `HOSTNAME.htb`) and the assigned IP address will be inserted. This operation needs **root/sudo/admin** permission. In Linux, you will be asked for entering your sudo password.  

```bash
htb-operator machine start --id 620 --update-hosts-file
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5399d44a-aaa5-4383-97fa-f4e90e00422b)


### `--wait-for-release`
Only works for scheduled machine. Starting the machine is paused until the release date/time will be reached and will be available for the entire community. It can be useful if you want to get a first blood. 
```bash
htb-operator machine start --id 620 --wait-for-release
```

### `--script <SCRIPT_FILE>`
Executes a custom bash script when all previous steps are done (i.e. an IP was assigned, possible VPN-Connection has been established, and so on). htb-operator will set the following environment variables:
* $HTB_MACHINE_IP -> Assigned IP
* $HTB_MACHINE_NAME -> Machine name (e.g. "Sea") 
* $HTB_MACHINE_OS -> Machine OS ("Linux", "Windows", "FreeBSD", ...)
* $HTB_MACHINE_DIFFICULTY -> Machine's difficulty (e.g. "Easy")
* $HTB_MACHINE_INFO -> Info provided by HTB
* $HTB_MACHINE_HOSTNAME -> Hostname (e.g. "sea.htb") 

#### Example
I would like to run following script:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo "Starting script, assigned IP $HTB_MACHINE_IP and Hostname $HTB_MACHINE_HOSTNAME"
nmap "$HTB_MACHINE_HOSTNAME" -p 80 --open
```
My call looks like (as you can see, I can combine the flags for automation):
```bash
htb-operator machine start --id 620 --script /tmp/example.sh --start-vpn --update-hosts-file
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de741502-87af-407d-aa33-a3e856e1d3bd)

In my case, I got a warning because I already had a running VPN conneciton. In general, this warning is for your information and you can ignore it.

## stop
This command stops an active running machine. This operation needs **root/sudo/admin** permission. In Linux, you will be asked for entering your sudo password.   
```bash
htb-operator machine stop
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29a0a12b-3247-4594-ade6-7f8a4aff9067)

### `--stop-vpn` 
Kills all running HTB-VPN-connection after stopping the machine.
```bash
htb-operator machine stop --stop-vpn
```

### `--clean-hosts-file`
Removes the hostname which matches the machine name from your hosts file. This operation needs **root/sudo/admin** permission. In Linux, you will be asked for entering your sudo password.  
```bash
htb-operator machine stop --clean-hosts-file
```

### Example
You can combine the "stop" flags mentioned above:
```bash
htb-operator machine stop --stop-vpn --clean-hosts-file
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57216405-e246-4c9c-8552-0bf8b289330e)

## reset
Just reset the active running machine.
```bash
htb-operator machine reset
```
### `--update-hosts-file`
Updates the hosts file, functioning exactly the same way as in `machine start`.
```bash
htb-operator machine reset --update-hosts-file
```

## extend
Extends the expiry time of the machine.
```bash
htb-operator machine extend
```

## status
Returns information about the active running machine.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/242ad7e9-95e9-42f1-a0f4-dea5afa8b085)

## info
Displays detailed information about a machine given by the flag `--id` or `--name`.
```bash
htb-operator machine info --id 620
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d426e72d-b26a-46f8-b30e-2dd9a3d6dbd9)

## submit
Sumbit the flag for the active machine. Use the flag `--user-flag` for submitting the user flag, `--root-flag` for the root flag. You also need to use the flag `-d` for specifying the difficulty rating (from 1="Piece of Cake" to 10="Brainfuck"). 
```bash
htb-operator machine submit --user-flag <FLAG> -d <DIFFICULTY_RATING>
```

## ssh-grab
A ssh connection will be established to the victim host. After that, it tries to grab the flag from `/home/USERNAME/user.txt` (for non-root) or `/root/root.txt` (for root user) and submit it to HTB for the active running machine. You also need to use the flag `-d` for specifying the difficulty rating (from 1="Piece of Cake" to 10="Brainfuck").
```bash
htb-operator machine ssh-grab -u <SSH-USERNAME> -p <SSH-PASSWORD> -i <TARGET_HOST> -d <DIFFICULT_RATING>
```

# challenge
The challenge command provides commands for listing all available challenges, displaying info about a specific challenge, downloading files and writeups, starting challenge instances or submitting flags. For example, if you want to download the file, unzip it and start the instance in HTB, you need only one command:
```bash
htb-operator challenge download --name "Hunting License" --unzip -s
```

## search
Using search, you are able to search for challenge which contain the name of the searching word. The argument `--name` is required.
```bash
htb-operator challenge search --name Spook
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/420f4564-b3d9-40ba-8ff6-f72ec7c54fe2)

### `--unsolved`
Displays only challenges which are not solved. If both `--solved` and `--unsolved` are speicifed, just unsolved challenges will be returned.

### `--solved`
Displays only challenges which are already solved. If both `--solved` and `--unsolved` are speicifed, just unsolved challenges will be returned.

### `--todo`
Displays only challenges whose `TODO`-Flag has been set.

###  `--category` 
Displays only challenges which are part of the specified category. You can specify more than one category, but they must be seperated by commas [,]. For example:
```bash
htb-operator challenge search --name Spook --category Web,Crypto,Pwn
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1475a94a-7017-4101-b742-de0838c77eab)

### `--difficulty`
Displays only challenges which matches the specified difficulty.


# Prolabs

## list
List all prolabs.
```bash
htb-operator prolabs list
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f5a1514-5260-4845-bcc7-5eada511a8b1)
