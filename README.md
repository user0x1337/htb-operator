HTB-Operator is a project developed and maintained by [user0x1337](https://github.com/user0x1337). It interacts with the API of HackTheBox, a popular cybersecurity training platform. The main objective is to save time while interacting with the platform of HTB.

# Installation
HTB-Operator is written in Python. In general, it can be executed on every OS if python is installed on this OS. But it was only tested on Linux (Kali, Ubuntu) and has some limitations on Windows (I was not in the mood for migrating some features for Windows...maybe later).

It is strongly recommended to create a venv. Use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/) to install `htb-operator`:
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/user0x1337/htb-operator
```

# Configuration
You need an API-token from HTB. For that:
1. Visit the URL: [https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/settings](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/settings)

2. Click on "Create App Token"

5. Call `htb-operator init -api YOUR_API_TOKEN`

# Commands
The tool is command based. You can call `-h` or `--help` for displaying the help information in each stage. The "top level" commands are displayed if you call the programm without any arguments:


```bash 
htb-operator
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dd6800d-53c1-464e-acb3-db61ca261082)


# init
TBD
# Info 
The `info` command retireves the information for a user. If no user is indicated, it will display the information for the authenticated user, i.e. for your user. 
```bash
htb-operator info
```

### `-s` / `--username`
Using `-s USERNAME` or `--username USERNAME` you can search for the user with the username `USERNAME` and display its profile. E.g.
```bash
htb-operator info -s HTBBot
```

### `-a` / `--activity`
Usually, the activity is limited to the recent 20 entries. Using `-a` or `--activity` shows the entire activity history without any limits.
```bash
htb-operator info -a
```
 
 `-s` / `--username` works with this flag, too.
```bash
htb-operator info -a -s HTBBot
```

# certificate

htb-operator certificate --list
```

### download
Using the `download` subcommand, you are able to download the certificate. With `--id` you have to indicate the certification id (e.g. obtained by listing all certificates) and with `-f` or `--filename`, you can set the target directory and the target filename.

# machine
The machine command provides commands for listing all available machines, displaying info about a specific machine, stop, reset and start a machine, and so on. 

## list
Lists all active and retired machines. Furthermore, you can add some filter flags for optimizing your view. Check out the provided flags with `htb-operator machine list -h`. 
```bash
htb-operator machine list
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ab1f19-d695-448c-816c-62268dc806eb)

Active machines which will be retired soon, are flagged as `✘/✔`.

### `--limit` 
As default only the 20 recent machines are displayed. If you want to increase or decrease the number of displyed machine, just use the `--limit <NUMBER>` flag. For example:
```bash
htb-operator machine list --limit 10
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2ad559b-944a-470e-932a-429d8d93e6b3)

### `--retired`

### `--active`
If the `--active` flag is set, only active machines are displayed. 
```bash
htb-operator machine list --active
```

### `--group-by-os` 
You can change grouping of the result set. Instead of grouping the result by `Retired` and `Active`, you can group the result by OS.
```bash
htb-operator machine list --group-by-os
```
