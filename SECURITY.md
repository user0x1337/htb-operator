# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since there is no release yet, security issues can be reported here.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

No trivial vulnerabilities. Since the user can start the tool as root/admin, "trivial" RCE or similar are not accepted if the RCE is executed as root. PrivEsc from user to root without entering the users root/sudo password are accepted.
